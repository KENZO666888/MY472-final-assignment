This is the repository where i host my code , data and a html file :https://github.com/KENZO666888/MY472-final-assignment.git

## 1.Introduction

This report employs data visualization techniques to investigate potential biases in stop and search practices by the UK police. The report is segmented into absolute and relative biases, aiming to determine if certain demographic groups defined by age, gender, and ethnicity are disproportionately affected. Additionally , it examines whether the UK police exhibit biases towards specific locations and times.
*The absolute proportion referred to below refers to the proportion of a group in the group that was searched that year, and the relative proportion refers to the proportion of the group in the total population that was searched.

## 2.Data Sources
UK Police Data API: This source provides records of stop and search incidents conducted by the UK police, detailing demographic information of individuals stopped, reasons for the stops, and outcomes. For this report, over 1.44 million detailed cases from 2020-2023 (from the last census to present) were extracted using an API, with kml files for police jurisdictional boundaries to construct a model for detecting geographical biases. (https://data.police.uk/docs/method/stops-force/)
(What needs to be noted here is that the calling range of the API started in December 2020, but in order to ensure the diversity of the data, I chose to retain the data of 2020. When relative variables such as proportions are involved below, I will use the data of 2020. But when it comes to absolute variables such as absolute numbers I will delete the data for 2020)

Office for National Statistics (ONS): This source offers demographic data for the UK population, primarily from the 2021 census, detailing total population figures across various demographic categories. (https://www.ons.gov.uk/census)

## 3.Data Processing
Extraction: Data from the UK Police Data API was extracted using R scripts, targeting specific endpoints to retrieve stop and search data from 2020-2022. The 2021 census data from ONS was also extracted using R scripts.

Cleaning and Aggregation: Absolute data processing involved cleaning the data to eliminate inconsistencies, standardizing formats, and aggregating to focus on key variables like age, gender, and ethnicity. The count function was utilized to ascertain the number of stop and search incidents per year and the total across 2020-2022 for various groups, subsequently determining the absolute proportion of searches for each demographic group.

Relative proportion calculation: Absolute data was then compared with ONS demographic statistics. This step involved aligning demographic categories between the two datasets and establishing mapping relationships to link different variables across both tables. Calculations were made to ascertain the relative stop and search probabilities for different ethnic groups , assessing whether some groups are more likely to be stopped and searched than others.

Temporal and Geographical Analysis: The data set includes mappings between geographic boundary coordinates and map data, as well as standardized 24-hour time format processing. The structure of these datasets is designed to analyze the continuous probability of being stopped and searched across different regions, times of day, and ages within the UK.

## 4.Analysis

ONS DATASET:
These 3 tables import UK population distribution from a file of census data obtained from ONS.Three tables will be created here. The first table is the overall population information, which is used to analyze the relative ratio of specific groups to the total population. The second and third tables are gender information separated by men and women, which is used for gender analysis.(Because the excel format provided by the ONS official website does not conform to the format that r can directly import.We can see that the structure here is very confusing, which will be dealt with later.)

# Analysis for total trend:

Based on the figure 4.1 (1), the number has gradually declined since 2021, indicating that the police's willingness to search and stop is declining under the influence of policies.

# 4.2 Geographical bias: Do police searches target certain areas?

In table 4.2(1), we do data processing produces frequency tables broken down by geography

In the four pictures of Figure 4.2, we generate total and yearly pie charts to observe the dynamics of caseloads and total distribution by geography

```



In the figure 4.2(5），we draw a map of the UK divided by force through the kml file, and draw the distribution of the number of cases in these areas

# Analysis for geographics:

Geographically, the overall search behavior in the UK, as shown in the Figure 4.2（4）and Figure 4.2（5), seems to be concentrated in major cities or densely populated areas, especially in London (Metropolitan), with a total of 438,487 searches, far exceeding other regions. Notably, areas with proportions exceeding 0.5% are significantly concentrated around major cities, which may reflect higher crime rates or more intensive police deployment in urban areas. However, when viewed annually through the Figure 4.2(1)-Figure 4.2(3), this concentration appears to be decreasing, with the proportion in the London area dropping from 44.8% to 36.06%, while other regions show an increase.

Conclusion: Big cities and surrounding cities receive bias from police

# Analysis for age:

Age-wise, the Figure 4.3(1) and Figure 4.3(2) indicate that the 18-24 age group is the primary target of searches, with the highest total number of searches (404,241) from 2020 -2023, accounting for 32.16%. However, there is a noticeable decline across the years in this and the 25-34 age brackets, averaging a 5% decrease, while proportions for those under 17 and over 34 have risen. The Figure 4.3(3) shows probabilities significantly higher than the average between ages 16-25 and 44-50. Excluding the broad range of 'over 34' due to lack of representativeness, it is evident that relative probabilities align with absolute probabilities

Conclusion: the 18-24 age group is subject to police bias.

# Analysis for Gender:

From a gender perspective, according to the figure 4.4(1) and the figure 4.4(2) , males account for an average of 90% of search cases, though there has been a decline over three years. The the figure 4.4(3) still shows males at eight times the relative probability of females.

In table 4.5(3),we import ONS data to obtain total population data of different ethnic groups in the UK
```{r Ethnicity TABLE 3, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

```

In table 4.5(4), we create a mapping match between the two tables according to race names to obtain the relative search proportions of the total reference population of different races.
```{r Ethnicity TABLE 4, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

In figure 4.5(3), we draw a distribution chart of the relative search rates of different races
```{r Ethnicity picture 3, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming you have the sorted table table_summary_by_ethics_processed

# Create a bar chart
plot <- ggplot(table_summary_by_ethics_processed, aes(x = reorder(Ethnic_Group, Search_to_Population_Ratio), y = Search_to_Population_Ratio)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#be8d4b", width = 0.5) + # Use a bar chart
  theme_minimal() + # Apply a minimal theme
  labs(title = "Figure 4.5(3):Relative Search Probability by Ethnic Group in 2021",
       x = "Ethnic Group",
       y = "Search to Population Ratio") +

# Analysis for Ethnic Group:

Regarding ethnicity, referring the Figure 4.5(1) and the Figure 4.5(2), whites dominate (63.59%) with a slight increase over three years, followed by blacks (19.97%) and Asians (12.91%). However , this is mainly influenced by the significantly higher total population of whites. The Figure 4.5(3) reveals that blacks have a search probability of 4.23%, significantly higher than Asians at 1.19% and Others at 1.28%, with whites only at a 0.61% search probability.Considering the slight increase for whites, it can be deduced that bias against blacks has eased over three years. 

Conclusion: blacks are subjected to higher investigative bias than other races.

# 4.6 Time bias : Are police more active at certain times of the day?

In table 4.6(1), we use the source data to convert the data format and summarize it into the 24-hour time distribution, and obtain the probability distribution table of searches in each hour.
```{r Time TABLE 4, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

# Remove rows where datetime column is NA and create a new dataframe
all_data_df_datetime <- all_data_df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(datetime)) %>%
  mutate(hour = hour(hms(substring(datetime, 12, 19)))) # Extract the hour

# Calculate the occurrence count for each hour
hourly_counts <- all_data_df_datetime %>%
  count(hour) %>%
  mutate(percentage = round((n / sum(n)) * 100, 3)) # Calculate the percentage

# Convert the percentage to a string and add a percentage sign
hourly_counts <- hourly_counts %>%
  mutate(percentage = paste0(percentage, "%"))

# Update the dataframe, add a time interval column, rename the n column, and rearrange columns to put percentage last
summary_by_time <- hourly_counts %>%
  mutate(Time = paste0(str_pad(hour, width = 2, pad = "0"), ":00-", str_pad(hour, width = 2, pad = "0"), ":59")) %>%
  select(-hour) %>%
  rename(Occurrences = n) %>%
  select(Time, Occurrences, percentage)

kable(summary_by_time, "html", caption = "Table 4.6(1): Time distribution of searches (in hours) ") %>%
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "bordered"),
    font_size = 12,
    full_width = FALSE
  ) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "black") %>%
  column_spec(1:ncol(summary_by_time), border_left = TRUE, border_right = TRUE, color = "black")

```

In figure 4.6(1) , we use a table to draw the probability distribution of police searches for 24 hours a day
```{r Time picture 1, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# Plot the graph
ggplot(summary_by_time, aes(x = Time, y = Occurrences, fill = "Occurrences")) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black", fill = "#be8d4b") +  # Draw a bar chart with black borders and a beige fill
  geom_text(aes(label = Occurrences), vjust = -0.3, color = "black", size = 2.5) +  # Add numbers on each bar and reduce font size
  theme_minimal() +  # Apply a minimalistic theme
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 10)) +  # Rotate the X-axis labels and reduce font size
  labs(title = "Figure 4.6(1): Hourly Search Occurrences", x = "Time", y = "Occurrences") # Label the plot

```


# Analysis for time:
Finally, the hourly frequency histogram of search cases reveals a distinct low point at 6 am, nearly ten times lower than the evening peak (3 pm-12 am, averaging 92,754 cases). There is a noticeable continuous decline from 12 am to 6 am and a corresponding rise from 6 am to 3 pm. 

Conclude: police searches are more prevalent during nighttime hours.

## 5.Conclusion
In summary, the comprehensive analysis suggests that in the UK, police search practices are inclined towards young males aged 17 to 24, particularly black individuals, with this trend being particularly pronounced in the London area and during nighttime hours. Moreover, since 2021, such biased search activities have been on a gradual decline.
